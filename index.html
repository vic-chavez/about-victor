<h2>My name is Victor. I'm 46 years old and I have recently moved from San Diego back to Albuquerque, where I was born.
    Upon moving from CA I also decided to switch career fields. This is my 3rd career in 26 years.
    My first career was a Chemical Operation Specialist in the US Army for 9 years spanning from 1996 to 2005.
    My second career was Instructional design, instructor, and e-learning developer from 2005-2020.</h2>
<h2>I have many hobbies but most recently I developed a joy for 3D printing, primarily miniatures.
    I enjoy motorcycle riding and have a great passion for music. I have played the cello since I was 10
    and am currently learning the guitar and tongue drum.</h2>
<h3>I am divorced and do not have children, however I do have 3 small furry kids that I love to death.
    As you can see in the first picture, they are quite the hams.</h3>
